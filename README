rc - a shell
============

This is rc, the Plan 9 shell, reimplemented for Unix by Byron Rakitzis.

The original rc was designed and implemented by Tom Duff at Bell Labs.
It has a small feature set similar to a traditional Bourne shell, but
with a much cleaner and simpler syntax. Among other things, this makes
rc much better than Bourne-compatible shells at handling filenames which
contain spaces. Thus, writing rc scripts is less error-prone than
writing sh scripts.

This reimplementation of rc can be linked with GNU readline, BSD
libedit, or similar line editing libraries, to make a pleasant
interactive shell.

Installation
------------

rc is built and installed using the following commands:

	$ make
	# make install

These steps require GNU make to be installed. Please also note, that the second
command requires root privileges. By default, rc is installed using the prefix
"/usr/local", so the full path of the executable will be "/usr/local/bin/rc".

You can install rc into a directory of your choice by changing the second
command to:

	# make PREFIX="/your/dir" install

The following non-standard make macros control the building of rc:

	EDIT
		Use a line-editing library, supported are: edit, editline,
		readline, vrl
	RC_ADDON
		Set to '1' to include extra builtins from addon.c
	RC_DEVELOP
		Set to '1' to include parse-tree dumper
	HASH_BANG
		Set to '0' if your system does not support '#!' executables
	HAVE_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS
		Set to '1' if your system automatically restarts syscalls after
		interruption by a signal

Example: To make rc use the readline library and include the extra builtins from addon.c, you have to build it with the following command:

	$ make EDIT=readline RC_ADDON=1

Additional build-time specific settings of rc can be found in the file
config.h. Please check and change them, so that they fit your needs. If the
file config.h does not already exist, then you have to create it with the
following command:

	$ make config.h
