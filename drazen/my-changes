For my scripts the most useful additions have been:
    calc 
    continue
    $pwd
${cmd} as an alias for `{cmd} made scripts nicer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
calc builtin
    calc 'EXP'
    calc 'v=EXP'
    calc 1 + 2
    calc '4 / 2'
    
    Borrowed from ksh and bash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
# 'continue' was merged to rakitzis
continue builtin
    while (cmd1) {
        if (cmd2) {
            continue
        }
        cmd3
    }

    Builtin 'break' was present - add 'continue' for completeness

---------------------------------------------------------------------
new builtins: calc, continue, kill, true, false
    Calc and continue are described above.
    Borrowed from ksh and bash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
${cmd}
    Equivalent to `{cmd}
    Suggested on rc github repository. Byron's repo does not have it
    as of March 2024.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$pwd
    Current working directory
    Borrowed from ksh and bash ($PWD)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ppid
    Parent process id
    Borrowed from ksh and bash ($PPID)
    Not resolved fully whether the value should change in a subshell.
    $pid does not change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$random
    Random number.
    Starts with a function of time.  Can be restarted with random=NUMBER.
    Borrowed from ksh and bash ($RANDOM)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
const* char
    Replace 'char*' with 'const char*' in many places.
    Safety.
    Reverted this to be closer to Byron's rc.
